# Introduction

Here some exercises to get to grips with R programming.

It assumed you know about variables and  
simple control flow
tools such as `for`-loops and `if`-`else`
statements. If you need more 
background on these topics, check out chapter 7 of [@Matloff2011]
or check online for videos on these topics. For example,
`for loops in R` on youtube provides a bunch of great videos. 
If you are reading / watching those examples, try to type
along. 

Sometimes there are hints provided in the exercises, for example:
"You can do this by using the `paste()` function", which involves
you checking out the documentation on this function and trying
some of the provided examples in the documentation.

## Keep a crash diary
I started to keep an Rcrash diary, in which I 
makes a list of the most persistent problems I have encountered 
(e.g., error messages that are less than informative, code not doing 
one's bidding), and add solutions later once I find them. 
This is a great lookup tool for commonly reoccurring errors.
